                <p>
                    Dear Lady of Fatima.
                    <br>We come on bended knees.
                    <br>To beg your intercession,
                    <br>For peace and unity.
                    <br>Dear Mary, won't you show us,
                    <br>The right and shining way.
                    <br>We pledge our love and offer you,
                    <br>A rosary each day.
                </p>
                <p>
                    You promised at Fatima,
                    <br>Each time that you appeared,
                    <br>To help us, if we pray to you,
                    <br>To banish war and fear.
                    <br>Dear Lady, on first Saturdays,
                    <br>We ask your guiding hands,
                    <br>For peace and guidance here on earth,
                    <br>And protection for our land.
                </p>
