            <h2>INSTRUCTION IN PRAYING THE ROSARY</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>Please read the meditations before each decade of the rosary.</li>
                <li>They say the following prayers for each decade of the rosary.
                    <p>
                       Say One Our Father:
                        <br><em>Our Father, who art in heaven, hollowed be Thy name, Thy kingdom come, Thy will be done on earth as it is in heaven.</em>
                        <br>Give us this day our daily bread and forgive us our trespasses, as we forgive those who trespass against us. And lead us not into temptation but deliver us from evil. Amen.
                    </p>
                    <p>Say Ten Hail Mary:
                        <br><em>Hail Mary full of grace, the Lord is with thee, blessed art thou amongst women, and blessed is the fruit of thy womb Jesus.</em>
                        <br>Holy Mary, Mother o God, pray for us sinners, now and at the hour of our death. Amen.</p>
                    <p> Say One Glory Be:
                        <br><em>Glory be to the Father, to the Son and to the Holy Spirit.</em>
                        <br>As it was in the beginning, is now and ever shall be world without end. Amen. </p>
                </li>
                <li>After each “The Glory be.”, pray:
                    <p><strong>O my Jesus, forgive us our sins, save us from the fires of hell and lead all souls into heaven, especially those who are in most need of thy mercy.</strong></p> </li>
                <li>Then sing:
                    <strong>
                        <br>Ave, Ave, Ave Maria
                        <br>Ave, Ave, Ave Maria</li> 
                    </strong>
                    
                <li>Then repeat the instruction, numbers 1 through 4 for the next four decades left.</li>
