            Beloved Lorenzo Ruiz, confronted with death, you proclaim your readiness to die a thousand time for your Christian faith. Today the whole world admires your courage. We feel particularly proud of you as our brother. 
            </p>
            <p>And we pray:
                <br>You, a family man, protect our families. Keep them united in love. You, who bore your sufferings with patience and resignation, intercede for the sick of mind and body; help them to receive the grace of God’s miraculous healing. You who died in a foreign country, take care of Filipinos living and working in this country, and in other parts of the world. You, an example of Christian fortitude, sustain our faith and make it spread and grow strong all arounds us. You, the Philippines first saint, be the country’s special protector. Unite us as one people; help us to work in harmony for development and progress; and give us peace. Amen.

        <div class="song">
            <p>
                Dear Lady of Fatima.
                <br>We come on bended knees.
                <br>To beg your intercession,
                <br>For peace and unity.
                <br>Dear Mary, won't you show us,
                <br>The right and shining way.
                <br>We pledge our love and offer you,
                <br>A rosary each day.
            </p>
            <p>
                You promised at Fatima,
                <br>Each time that you appeared,
                <br>To help us, if we pray to you,
                <br>To banish war and fear.
                <br>Dear Lady, on first Saturdays,
                <br>We ask your guiding hands,
                <br>For peace and guidance here on earth,
                <br>And protection for our land.
